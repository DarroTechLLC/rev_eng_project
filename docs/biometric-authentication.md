# Biometric Authentication Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of biometric authentication in the RevEng Project. The implementation uses the Web Authentication API (WebAuthn) to enable users to register and authenticate with biometric credentials such as fingerprints, facial recognition, or hardware security keys.

## Implementation Details

### Server-Side Components

1. **WebAuthnController**: A new controller that handles WebAuthn operations:
   - `/webauthn/available` - Checks if biometric authentication is available for the current user
   - `/webauthn/register/options` - Generates registration options for creating a new biometric credential
   - `/webauthn/register/verify` - Verifies registration response and stores the credential
   - `/webauthn/authenticate/options` - Generates authentication options for using a biometric credential
   - `/webauthn/authenticate/verify` - Verifies authentication response and logs the user in

2. **AuthenticationController**: Modified to make the `setUserInSession` method public so it can be accessed from the `WebAuthnController`.

### Client-Side Components

1. **webauthn.js**: A JavaScript file that handles WebAuthn client-side operations:
   - Checking if WebAuthn is supported by the browser
   - Registering a new biometric credential
   - Authenticating with a biometric credential
   - Checking if biometric authentication is available for the current user

2. **Login Page**: Updated to include a biometric login button that appears if biometric authentication is available.

3. **Account Page**: Updated to include a biometric registration card that allows users to register their biometric credentials.

### Data Storage

The current implementation uses in-memory storage for challenges and credentials:

```java
// In-memory challenge storage - in production, this should be in a database or Redis
private static final Map<String, byte[]> challengeStorage = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();

// In-memory credential storage - in production, this should be in a database
private static final Map<String, Map<String, byte[]>> credentialStorage = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();
```

In a production environment, these should be stored in a database.

## User Flow

### Registration

1. User logs in with username and password
2. User navigates to the account page
3. User clicks the "Register Biometric Authentication" button
4. The browser prompts the user to use their biometric authenticator (fingerprint, face, etc.)
5. The biometric credential is registered and stored

### Authentication

1. User enters their username on the login page
2. User clicks the "Login with Biometrics" button
3. The browser prompts the user to use their biometric authenticator
4. If the authentication is successful, the user is logged in

## Limitations

The current implementation has the following limitations:

1. **In-Memory Storage**: Credentials and challenges are stored in memory, which means they will be lost when the server restarts. In a production environment, these should be stored in a database.

2. **Simplified Verification**: The implementation uses simplified verification logic. In a production environment, more robust verification should be implemented.

3. **No Credential Management**: There's no way for users to manage (view, delete) their registered credentials.

## Future Enhancements

### Free Options

1. **Database Storage**: Store credentials and challenges in a database for persistence.

2. **Credential Management**: Add functionality for users to view and delete their registered credentials.

3. **Multiple Credentials**: Allow users to register multiple biometric credentials.

4. **Improved Error Handling**: Add more robust error handling and user feedback.

### Paid Options

1. **FIDO2 Server**: Use a FIDO2 server like [StrongKey](https://www.strongkey.com/) or [Yubico](https://www.yubico.com/) for more robust authentication.

2. **Identity Providers**: Integrate with identity providers like Auth0, Okta, or Firebase Authentication that support biometric authentication.

3. **Enterprise Features**: Add enterprise features like multi-factor authentication, adaptive authentication, and audit logging.

4. **Mobile SDK**: Use a mobile SDK for native biometric authentication in mobile apps.

## Conclusion

This implementation provides a basic biometric authentication solution using the Web Authentication API. It's suitable for development purposes and can be enhanced with additional features as needed.
