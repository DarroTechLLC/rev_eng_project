# üè¢ Company Selector - Always Visible Solution

## Problem Statement ‚ùå

The company selector dropdown image was flashing/blinking during navigation because:
- Every page navigation triggered a full page reload
- The company selector state was not persisted across navigation
- The entire DOM was recreated on each page load
- No immediate state restoration from cache
- Flash of Unstyled Content (FOUC) occurred during loading
- **CRITICAL ISSUE**: Company selector was sometimes invisible on initial load

## Solution Overview ‚úÖ

Implemented a comprehensive solution that ensures the company selector is **ALWAYS VISIBLE** and **NEVER BLINKS**:

### 1. **Always Visible Approach** üëÅÔ∏è
- **Immediate Visibility**: Company selector is visible from the moment the page loads
- **No Hidden States**: CSS ensures the selector is never hidden or invisible
- **Fallback Content**: Always shows something (loading, logo, or placeholder)
- **Force Visibility**: CSS `!important` rules prevent any hiding

### 2. **Enhanced State Management** üíæ
- **Persistent Cache**: Stores company data in localStorage with timestamp
- **State Synchronization**: Keeps server and client state in sync
- **Event System**: Custom events for state changes
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for failed loads

### 3. **Visual Stability** üé®
- **Fixed Dimensions**: Prevents layout shifts during loading
- **No Transitions**: Removes transitions that could cause flashing
- **Loading States**: Non-flashing loading indicators
- **Image Preloading**: Handles image load/error states

## Technical Implementation üîß

### File Structure
```
rev-eng-project/src/main/resources/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ templates/fragments/company-selector.html    # Main component
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ static/css/company-selector.css              # Dedicated styles
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ templates/test-company-selector.html         # Test page
```

### Key Components

#### 1. **Preload Script** (`company-selector-preload`)
```javascript
// Executes immediately in <head>
window.CompanySelectorState = {
    init: function() {
        this.restoreFromCache();
        this.addVisibilityCSS(); // Ensures always visible
    },
    addVisibilityCSS: function() {
        // CSS that forces visibility with !important
    },
    applyToDOM: function() {
        // Always applies content, even if no cached data
    }
};
```

#### 2. **Always Visible CSS**
```css
.company-selector {
    opacity: 1 !important;
    visibility: visible !important;
    display: block !important;
    transition: none !important;
}

#currentCompanyDisplay {
    visibility: visible !important;
    opacity: 1 !important;
    display: flex !important;
}
```

#### 3. **Enhanced JavaScript** (`company-selector-script`)
```javascript
// Always visible approach
function ensureVisibility() {
    const selector = document.querySelector('.company-selector');
    const display = document.getElementById('currentCompanyDisplay');
    
    if (selector) {
        selector.style.opacity = '1';
        selector.style.visibility = 'visible';
        selector.style.display = 'block';
    }
}
```

## How It Works üîÑ

### 1. **Page Load Sequence**
1. **Preload Script** executes immediately in `<head>`
2. **Visibility CSS** applied to ensure company selector is always visible
3. **DOM Ready** - company selector is immediately visible with fallback content
4. **State Restoration** - cached data applied if available
5. **Server Data** fetched in background
6. **State Sync** - server data updates cache if different

### 2. **Navigation Flow**
1. **Before Navigation** - state preserved in localStorage
2. **Page Load** - company selector immediately visible with fallback
3. **No Flash** - always shows content, never hidden
4. **Background Sync** - fresh data fetched without visual disruption

### 3. **Company Selection**
1. **User Clicks** - company selection initiated
2. **Loading State** - non-flashing loading indicator (still visible)
3. **Server Request** - company selection API call
4. **Cache Update** - new company data cached
5. **Navigation** - page redirects to new company context

## Testing üß™

### Test Page
Visit `/test-company-selector` to test the solution:

1. **Load Test Page** - Company selector should be immediately visible
2. **Navigate Between Pages** - Company selector should remain visible and stable
3. **Change Company** - Only changes when manually selected
4. **Check Console** - Detailed logs for debugging
5. **Visibility Monitor** - Real-time visibility status

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Load any page with company selector
2. Verify company selector is immediately visible
3. Navigate to different pages using sidebar links
4. Observe company selector - should remain visible and stable
5. Manually change company - should update smoothly
6. Refresh page - should restore previous selection

### Console Monitoring
```javascript
// Check state manager
console.log(window.CompanySelectorState);

// Monitor company selection events
document.addEventListener('companySelected', function(event) {
    console.log('Company selected:', event.detail);
});

// Check visibility
const selector = document.querySelector('.company-selector');
console.log('Visibility:', selector.style.visibility);
console.log('Opacity:', selector.style.opacity);
console.log('Display:', selector.style.display);
```

## Troubleshooting üîß

### Common Issues

#### 1. **Company Selector Not Visible**
- Check if preload script is loading early enough
- Verify CSS is being applied correctly
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure no other CSS is hiding the element

#### 2. **State Not Persisting**
- Check localStorage is enabled
- Verify cache timestamp is valid
- Check for JavaScript errors

#### 3. **Images Not Loading**
- Verify image URLs are correct
- Check network connectivity
- Ensure fallback placeholders work

### Debug Commands
```javascript
// Check state manager
console.log(window.CompanySelectorState);

// Check cached data
console.log(localStorage.getItem('cachedCompanyData'));

// Force refresh cache
localStorage.removeItem('cachedCompanyData');

// Check DOM elements
console.log(document.getElementById('currentCompanyDisplay'));

// Check visibility
const selector = document.querySelector('.company-selector');
console.log('Visibility:', selector.style.visibility);
console.log('Opacity:', selector.style.opacity);
console.log('Display:', selector.style.display);
```
